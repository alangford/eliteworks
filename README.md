The boiler plate for this app is made through an npm module named create-react-app.
 
 To run this app you must have node installed
 and run the command 'npm install or yarn install'
 and then run 'node test-server' and then navigate to localhost:3046
 
 To browse through the code base you can find everything I built in the source/src folder.
 
 I built this project with redux to show the capabilities I have with React and redux.
 
 I put special comments throughout the code to specify what certain functions do.
 
 I made all the calls with an npm module named axios.
